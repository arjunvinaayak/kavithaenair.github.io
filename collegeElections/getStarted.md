This app helps you conduct election using twitter as the platform!

The voters have to tweet mentioning the name of the candidate they want
to vote for.
In order to know the results enter the name of the two candidates
in the input fields and press compare.

The number of votes acquired by each of the candidates are shown
and a pie chart is also plotted using the data.
