## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.  
Every time you change the content of the text box with a new film name and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the results should update automatically. However, if it doesn't work, you can use the *Search!* button at the right.
